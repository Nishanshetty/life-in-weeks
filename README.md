# Life in Weeks Tracker  

Inspired by [Gina Trapani's Life in Weeks](https://weeks.ginatrapani.org/), this project is my personal adaptation of the concept. The goal of this website is to provide a visual representation of life in weeks, helping me reflect on how I spend my time and track meaningful events.  

## Why This Project?  
I found the idea of tracking life in weeks to be a simple yet powerful way to gain perspective on time. This project allows me to:  
- Visualize my life in weeks.  
- Log significant events and milestones.  
- Stay mindful of how I use my time.
